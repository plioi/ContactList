# Warning!

The purpose of this repo is for its creator to experiment with ASP.NET web application patterns as the state of the art advances over the years.

Changes here are meant to be extremely opinionated, and we will simply have different opinions on something so subjective.

The content *and the history* are very likely to be heavily altered occasionally, so that the history itself can be focused on illustrating the change in patterns over time.

Your work in submitting an issue here may very well be lost in the next history revision.

If you've found a bug, or spotted a likely-unintentional error, thank you for submitting an issue!
